    coat is your overalls, it keeps you safe from chemicals and is somewhat fire
    resistant. Start with a lab coat \u2013 fully buttoned or zipped up.  Tie back
    long hair and remove dangling jewelry.  Wear closed-toe shoes \u2013 no sandals
    or slippers allowed. After use, dispose of single-use PPE properly and clean
    reusable ones.  Once you do all of this you can check this task as complete  "
