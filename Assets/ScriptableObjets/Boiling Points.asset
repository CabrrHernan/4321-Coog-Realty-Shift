  taskName: Boiling Points Lab
  description: "<b>Task:</b> Boiling Points\r\n\r\nThe boiling point of a substance
    is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid equals the surrounding
    pressure, causing it to change into vapor. Identifying boiling points is a key
    method for distinguishing clear, colorless liquids in lab experiments.\r\n\r\nIn
    this lab, you\u2019ll identify three unknown dyed liquids based on their boiling
    points:  \r\n\u2022 Water (H\u2082O)  \r\n\u2022 Cyclohexane (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082) 
    \r\n\u2022 Propylene Glycol (C\u2083H\u2088O\u2082)\r\n\r\n<b>Steps:</b>  \r\n\u2022
    Place a beaker on the hot plate and increase the temperature until it starts
    boiling. Note the temperature.  \r\n\u2022 Turn off the heat and allow the beaker
    to cool.  \r\n\u2022 Repeat the process for the remaining two beakers.  \r\n\u2022
    Match each boiling point to its corresponding compound.\r\n\r\n<b>Completion:</b> 
    \r\nOnce all liquids have been identified by their boiling points, you can mark
    this task as complete.\r\n"
